# CXLS Hitfinder 

The goal is this project is to lay the foundations for developing data analysis techniques for the CXLS using deep neural networks. 
The hitfinder CNN takes in diffraction pattern HDF5 images and determines what images have Bragg peak signal in them. 
Once determined, other analysis tools can be used on the selected HDF5 images.
