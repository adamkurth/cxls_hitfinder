## Rational Behind the Model

### Problem:

- *Long term goal*: We will simulate diffraction intensity images of a protein, and then use a CNN to predict the protein structure given the diffraction intensity images.

- *Short term goal*: Will simulate diffraction intensity images of protein 1IC6.pdb (at first), then apply water background noise to all the "*peak only*" images, then use both peak-only and peak + water noise images to train a CNN to predict the protein structure. Each 10,000 (20,000 including water-noise images) images will be generated at a given `clen` or camera length away from the interaction point. 
  
- Given the 20,000 images, we want predict (a) camera length away from the interaction point, and (b) the protein structure from the peak patterns on the image.

#### Base Architecture:

1. **ResNet**: a Residual Network (ResNet), could serve as the backbone for feature extraction, thanks to its deep architecture and ability to combat vanishing gradients, allowing it to learn rich features even from complex images. 

    **Overview**: renowned for its ability to train very deep networks by usng skip connections or shortcuts to jump over some layers. These connections help mitigate the *vanishing gradient problem*, which is the problem of the gradients becoming increasingly small as the network becomes deeper, making it hard to train. Thus, this allows for deeper network architectures without degredation in performance.

    **Why**: The ResNet variants (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152) enables it to learn a wide variety of features from diffraction images which is crucial for identifying subtle patterns indicitive of the protein structure. Its ability to effectively propogate gradients through many layers makes it ideal for learning from complex, high-dimensional data images typically in crystallagraphy.

2. **U-Net**: Originally for biomedical imaging segmentation, this architecture could be adapted to peak detection. Its ability to capture context at different resulutions (image sense of the word) and precisely localize the features makes it suitable for identifying the peaks in in noisy backgrounds.

   **Overview**: Originally designed for biomedical image segmentation, U-Net's architecture is unique for its use of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.

   **Why**: The U-Net can be particularly effective if the task involves not just classifying the entire image but also identifying the specific regions within the image that correspond to peaks or other features relevant to protein structure prediction. Its structure is advantageous for tasks requiring precise spacial localization of features, which could be useful for peak detection with noisy backgrounds.
   
3. **Inception Networks (GoogLeNet)**: The Inception Network is known for its efficient use of computational resources, thanks to its inception module. This module is a combination of 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolutions, as well as max pooling, which allows the network to learn from features at different scales.

   **Overview**: Inception networks utilize inception modules, which allow the network to choose from different kernel sizes at each block, enabling it to adaptively capture information at various scales.

   **Why**: The varying sizes of the convolutional kernels in the inception modules allow the network to be efficient in terms of computation and parameters while being powerful in capturing features at different scales, which is critical for analyzing diffraction patterns that may vary significantly in size and shape across different protein structures.

4. **Attention Mechanisms (e.g., SENet)**: 
    **Overview**: Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) introduce a mechanism to recalibrate channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. This attention mechanism enhances the representational power of the network.
    
    **Why**: Given the variability in the significance of different features in the diffraction images, especially with the introduction of noise, the ability of SENet to focus on the most relevant features could improve the accuracy of predicting protein structures from the images.

5. **DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolution Networks)**:
    
    **Overview**: DenseNet improves upon the idea of skip connections in ResNet by connecting each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. This architecture ensures maximum information flow between layers in the network.
    
    **Why**: The feature reuse in DenseNet makes it particularly efficient for learning from limited data, which might be beneficial given the specific nature of the protein structures and the complexity introduced by noise in the images. DenseNet's efficiency and compactness could lead to better performance on tasks with high computational complexity like protein structure prediction from crystallography images.

#### Proposed Architecture:

- **ResNet + Attention Mechanisms**: 
   **Quickly**: (See ResNet above) ResNet architectures, especially deeper versions like ResNet-101 or ResNet-152, are highly capable of capturing complex patterns in images due to their deep structure supported by residual connections. These connections help in training very deep networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem, making them highly effective for tasks requiring detailed feature extraction from images, such as identifying specific patterns in diffraction intensity images indicative of protein structures.

    **Enhancements**: To further boost the performance of a ResNet-based model, you could integrate attention mechanisms, such as the Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks or non-local blocks, which would allow the model to focus more on relevant features within the diffraction images. This is *particularly useful when dealing with images with variable noise levels, as it helps in distinguishing between noise and meaningful signal.*

- **Transformer-based Models for Vision (ViT)**: 
    **Quickly**: Given the recent success of Transformer models in various domains, including natural language processing and image recognition tasks, a Vision Transformer (ViT) model could be another excellent choice. Transformers *treat the image as a sequence of patches and learn global dependencies between them*, which could be particularly beneficial for understanding the global structure of protein based on local diffraction patterns.

    **Advantages**: The Transformer architecture's ability to *capture long-range interactions between different parts of the image could provide a significant advantage in predicting the protein structure from diffraction intensity images.* This aspect is crucial when the relationship between different peaks (or features) in the image directly influences the inferred protein structure.


- #### Considerations: 
  - Given the computational resouces at your disposal, and the goal of pushing the boundaries of what's achievable with current deep learning techniques in crystallography, starting with a ResNet-based architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms offers a solid foundation with proven capabilities in image processing tasks. This approach combines the strength of deep convolutional networks with the ability to focus on the most informative parts of an image, making it well-suited for the complexities of your task.
  - Simultaneously, *exploring Transformer-based models tailored for vision tasks could offer groundbreaking insights*, especially in terms of learning global dependencies and handling the complex patterns found in diffraction intensity images.
  - **Prototyping**: Given the novelty of the task and the resources available, an iterative approach that involves prototyping with both architectures, evaluating performance, and then refining or combining models based on empirical results would be the most effective strategy. This process allows for the discovery of the most suitable model architecture or combination thereof for predicting protein structures from diffraction intensity images accurately.
