1. Simulate images (not water background) with specific protein and first detector distance 
2. Keep these images on agave, but apply the water background to these images and copy them to a new directory
   - Make sure there are empty images (only water in the image) and images with peaks
3. Train the neural network on the images with the water background and normal images
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the second detector distance
